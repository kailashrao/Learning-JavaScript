# Subscribe to Mailing List

![Mailing List Subscription Example](image.png)

## Goal:
Setup a program that asks the user for their email and stores it for use in a mailing list.

## Possible Solutions:
1. Use a text file to store emails (requires node.js)
2. Use a database

## Conclusion
- In a real application, it is not recomended to use client side files (like text files) due to security concerns. For this reason, vanilla JS does not have good native support for file management
- For this situation, using a database is ideal for storing user information
